# Personal Website

https://www.richardjonbacon.com/

My personal website which contains a short bio, my portfolio and contact information.

The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), with a custom domain.

## Development

The site was built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/), a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based framework for building websites.

Gatsby was chosen for a number of reasons:

- I had React experience and so wanted to build on that knowledge
- I wanted to build a simple static website
- I wanted to learn more about Gatsby and the JAMStack in general

The process I followed was:

- Setup the project using the Gatsby Setup Wizard
- Replace default starter code and install development dependencies
- Add site metadata using React Helmet
- Create the home page layout and section components
- Add portfolio projects content using markdown
- Refine styling and add media queries for responsive design
- Add pwa and offline support
- Perform accessibility and performance checks using Lighthouse

## Future Plans

- Add a blog and feature recent posts on the home page
- Add a theme switcher and / or dark mode

## Built With

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
