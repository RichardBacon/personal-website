Budding is a mobile app that allows the user to track the growth and progress of plants.

It consists of a cross-platform mobile app on the frontend, and a backend RESTful API which performs operations on a database.

This collaborative project was created in a group of 4 as part of the Northcoders coding bootcamp.
